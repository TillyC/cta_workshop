## Textile Sensors 

How to make electronic sensors from scratch using textiles. I will provide the materials however, if you have your own yarn and crochet hook that you are comfortable using then feel free to bring those along. Hopefully everyone will leave the workshop with a functioning sensor that does something ...

## Tools
### Textiles
 - Normal yarn
