## Textile Sensors 

How to make electronic sensors from scratch using textiles. I will provide the materials however, if you have your own yarn and crochet hook that you are comfortable using then feel free to bring those along. Hopefully everyone will leave the workshop with a functioning sensor that does something ...

## Tools
### Textiles
 - Normal yarn
 - Conductive yarn
 - Crochet hook
### Electronics
 - Raspberry Pi
 - 2 x crocodile clips
 - wires (how many?)
 - resistor (ohms?)
 - breadboard

## Step by Step 
### Intro
### Making the Sensor
### Write the code
### Set up the Pi
To get audio to play from the raspberry pi, we need to make sure to select te correct output. The Pi defaults to the headphone jack but since we have USB speakers we need to go into the settings to change that. 

raspi config 

enter

audio - enter

usb device enter

back

finish 

### Test it out
### Customise
